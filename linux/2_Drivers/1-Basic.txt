==== Character Drivers :- ====

**Q:- What is device node in drivers ?.**
1. Device node number on the special file connects it to a specific device driver in the Unix kernel. 
2. A device node is created with the command mknod. 
3. The device nodes are stored in or have links to the /dev directory. 
4. When the ls -l command is used to list these files, their major and minor numbers are displayed.
5. Device nodes (often referred to simply as "devices" in casual conversation) are the files that the kernel, applications, 
	and even command-line tools use when they need to access the hardware. 

**Q:- What is dynamic & static driver allocation ?.**

	Static Allocation of node : -		sudo mknod /dev/chardrv_dynamic c 249 0
	Dynamic Allocation of node :-	By c driver only
	
	== 	if (IS_ERR(cl = class_create(THIS_MODULE, "char"))) ==
	
	**	{**
	**		cdev_del(&c_dev);**
	**		unregister_chrdev_region(mydev, MINOR_CNT);**
	**		return PTR_ERR(cl);**
	**	}**
	
	== 	if (IS_ERR(dev_ret = device_create(cl, NULL, mydev, NULL, "mychar%d", FIRST_MINOR))) ==
	
	**	{**
	**		class_destroy(cl);**
	**		cdev_del(&c_dev);**
	**		unregister_chrdev_region(mydev, MINOR_CNT);**
	**		return PTR_ERR(dev_ret);**
	**	}**

**Q: What is use __init keyword for driver init function ?.**
**A:-**	
This keyword helps kernel to allocate memory when driver is inserted in kernel. & when exit then that memory will de-allocated to that particular specific driver.
