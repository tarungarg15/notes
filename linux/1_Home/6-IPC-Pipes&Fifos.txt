== PIPE :- ==
	* Connecting Data from one process to another. When pip attached bwteen two process then output of one process will be given to input of other process.
	* A pipe is designated in commands by the vertical bar character, e.g. cmd1 | cmd2

== PIPE Example :-  Just remember popen also calls pipe function ==

	popen definition is defined here : -

== Pipes :- ==
created used & destroyed with in file as a set of process. Each end of pipe has its own file descriptorone end is for reading & other end for writing. when use has done pipe closed.
	1. unidirectional
	2. shell use pipe between two process.
	3. two fd p[0],p[1]
	4. created by shell
	5. opened at time of creation.
	6. Realted Process share same descriptor table

**Fifos : -**  are knows as named pipes. exist as special file in FS. They exists untill they are removed with rm or unlink command. They can be used with unrelated process.
	1. Bi-directional
	2. Allow independent process to find pipe.
	3. Only one fd
	4. created by mkfifo
	5. Not opened at time of creation.
	6. Unrelated process share different  descriptor table

**Disadvantages  of pipes : -** 
	* Can't strore much data
	* No message boundaries.
	* Data treated as strength of buffer
	* Data can't be broadcast to multiple receiver

**Disadvantages  of FIFO : -** 
	* Data can't be broad casted to many receivers
	* can't used accross n/w
	* less secure than pipe
	* can't store data
	* No message boundaries
