====== HTTP Server Client ======
Created Monday 16 October 2017

[ ] The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-level protocol for distributed, collaborative, hypermedia information systems. 
[ ] This is the foundation for data communication for the World Wide Web (i.e. internet) since 1990. 
[ ] HTTP is a generic and stateless protocol which can be used for other purposes as well using extensions of its request methods, error codes, and headers.

[ ] Basically, HTTP is a TCP/IP based communication protocol, that is used to deliver data (HTML files, image files, query results, etc.) on the World Wide Web. 
[ ] The default port is TCP 80, but other ports can be used as well. It provides a standardized way for computers to communicate with each other. 
[ ] HTTP specification specifies how clients' request data will be constructed and sent to the server, and how the servers respond to these requests.

==== Basic Features ====

**There are three basic features that make HTTP a simple but powerful protocol:**

**HTTP is connectionless:** 
* The HTTP client, i.e., a browser initiates an HTTP request and after a request is made, the client disconnects from the server and waits for a response
* The server processes the request and re-establishes the connection with the client to send a response back.

**HTTP is media independent:** 
* It means, any type of data can be sent by HTTP as long as both the client and the server know how to handle the data content. 
* It is required for the client as well as the server to specify the content type using appropriate MIME-type.

**HTTP is stateless:** 
* HTTP is connectionless and it is a direct result of HTTP being a stateless protocol. 
* The server and client are aware of each other only during a current request. 
* Afterwards, both of them forget about each other. 
* Due to this nature of the protocol, neither the client nor the browser can retain information between different requests across the web pages.
