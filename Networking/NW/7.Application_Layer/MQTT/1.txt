====== Connect ======

* Basically client sends the connection request to server or broker.
* The CONNECT packet must be sent only once over a network connection. 
* The second CONNECT Packet sent from a Client will be ignored and disconnected.
* **Message contains** 
	* __Fixed header__
	* __Variable header__
	* __Payload__
	* __Response__

* Payload of connect message contains one or three encoded strings
* If will flag is set then then payload must cntain three UTF encoded strings

	1. **Client Identifier :-** 
		a. The first UTF-encoded string. The Client Identifier (Client ID) is between 1 and 23 characters long, and uniquely identifies the client to the broker. 
		b. It must be unique across all clients connecting to a single broker, and is the key in handling Message IDs messages with QoS levels 1 and 2. 
		c. If the Client ID contains more than 23 characters, the broker responds to the CONNECT message with a CONNACK return code 2: Identifier Rejected.
	2. **Will Topic :- **
		a. The second UTF-encoded string. 
		b. The Will Message is published to the Will Topic. 
		c. The QoS level is defined by the Will QoS field, and the RETAIN status is defined by the Will RETAIN flag in the variable header.

	3. **Will Message**
		a. The third UTF-encoded string. 
		b. The Will Message defines the content of the message that is published to the Will Topic if the client is unexpectedly disconnected.
	
		Although the Will Message is UTF-encoded in the CONNECT message, when it is published to the Will Topic only the bytes of the message are sent, not the first two length bytes. The message sent when the broker executes the Will Message is raw ASCII, not UTF-encoded.

* The broker sends a CONNACK message in response to a CONNECT message from a client.
* If the client does not receive a CONNACK message from the broker within a "reasonable" amount of time, the client closes the TCP/IP socket connection, and restarts the session by opening a socket to the broker and issuing a CONNECT message. 
* A "reasonable" amount of time depends on the type of application and the communications infrastructure.
