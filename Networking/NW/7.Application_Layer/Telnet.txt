====== Telnet ======
Created Tuesday 24 October 2017

====== Concept : - ======

* Telent is Terminal Network. 
* It is standard TCP/IP protocol for virtual terminal as proposed by ISO
* Telent enables the establishment of a connection to a remote system in such a way that local terminal appears to be a terminal at the remote system.
* Rlogin is a remote login protocol provided by BSD Unix.
* Purpose of the TELNET Protocol is to provide a fairly general,   bi-directional, eight-bit byte oriented communications facility.
* Primary goal is to allow a standard method of interfacing terminal  devices and terminal-oriented processes to each other.  
* Protocol may also be used for terminal-terminal  communication ("linking") and process-process communication.
* A TELNET connection is a Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)  connection used to transmit data with TELNET control information.



**Telnet is a client-server protocol**, based on a reliable connection-oriented transport. 
Typically, this protocol is used to establish a connection to Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) port number 23, 
where a Telnet server application (telnetd) is listening. 
Telnet, however, predates TCP/IP and was originally run over Network Control Program (NCP) protocols.


**TELNET Protocol is built upon three main ideas:**  

	1. Cconcept of a "Network Virtual Terminal"
	2. The principle of negotiated options 
	3. A symmetric view of terminals and processes.


== Time sharing Environment :- ==
* It is basically a time sharing environment.
* A large computers supports multiple users.
* The interaction between a user & computer through a terminal 

=== Login ===

* In time sharing environment users are part of system with some rights to access teh resource
* Each authorized has identification & probably a paswword also
* User authentification dfines the user as a part of system
* To access sysetm user logs into the system with user id or login name.
* The system also facilitates password checks the password

=== Types of Login :- ===

	1. === Local Login : - ===

	* When user logs to local system
	* when user types on terminal then whatever uswer types on terminal it is accepted by terminal driver which passes characters to OS
	* Based on user inputs terminal driver executes application.

=== Remote Login :- ===


	* When user wants to access asn application program or utility located on remote machine
	* Telnet client & server program comes into use
	* Here user send the keystrokes to terminal driver where the local OS accespts characters but does not interpret them.
	* Characters send to Telent client which transforms the characters to a universal characters called **Network Terminal Characters** & delivers them to local TCP/IP stack.

	* The commands or text in NVT form which travels through the Internet & arrives at TCP/IP stack at the remote machine
	* Characters are delivered to OS & passed to Telnet server which can understand the characters by remote computers.
	* But remember characters cannot passed directly to OS from Telent server
	* It is designed to receive the characters from TELNET server.
	* OS basically gets the data through terminal driver.


=== Network Virtual Terminal (NVT):- ===

* Basically todays world we work with many different types of systems
* To access remote system we must know what types of computer used by that computer

	**But TELNET solves this problem**

* Provides the universal interface called Netowrk Virtual Terminal (NVT) character set
* Telent client translates into NVT form & delivers them to network.
* The Telnet Server translates data & command from NVT form which is acceptable by remote computer

=== NVT Character set : ===
	
	Types 
	1. one for Data
	2. one for Remote control

	Both are 8 bit bytes
	

=== Data Characters : - ===
* NVT normally uses called NVT ASCII
* This is 8 bit character set in which 7 lower bits same as US ASCII & highest order bit is 0
* It is possible to send highest order bit is 0 or 1 but must be agreed upon client & server

=== Remote control Characters : - ===
* NVT uses an eight bit charcter set in which highest order bit is set.

=== Embedding :- ===

* Telent uses only one TCP connection
* Server uses port 23 & cleint uses an ephemeral port.
* Same connection is sued for sending the both data & remote control characters


=== Options : - ===

* During the use of Telent TELNET can negotiate options before or during the services.

=== Option Negotiation :- ===

* To use any option first requires negotiation between client & server.
* Four control characters are used for this purpose.
