====== 7.Application Layer ======
Created Saturday 14 October 2017

The OSI model defines the application layer as the user interface responsible for displaying received information to the user.


	* Abstraction layer used by host
	* Usual way of hiding â†’ Implementation details of particular set of functionality
	* Application layer only standerdize communication :-
		1. **Peer to peer**
			a. two or more computers connected to same network without having the dedicated server. 
				 every connected device can act as server or client
				
	2. **Client server model**
		a. Device who req info is called client. Device who responds is called server
  
	3. **host to host**
	4. Provides set of protocol which are used in this layer
	5. It is layer where actual communication starts
	6. Provides end user access to verify of shared services
	7. Includes error handling recovery Data flow over N/W Full N/W flow
	8. Helps to develop N/W based application
	9. When any  **Application Software **sends a message then **Application layer s/w** accespts same                                                                                                      message as I/P from **Application Software **which further adds additional data such as address of target computer.
	10. May Chop data into chunks
	11. May wait for reply

=== How Application protocl has to work on both server & client side :- ===

* Must be implemented on both sides
* Protocol should only establish if both side rules are followed 
* Protocol specifies how data inside message is stuctured & types of messages
* Messages should always request for :
	* Services
	* Acknowledgement
	* Data messages
	* Status messages
	* Error messages
