====== ICMP ======
Created Monday 16 October 2017

* ICMP is actually a user of IP protocol--in other words, ICMP messages must be encapsulated within IP packets. 
* ICMP is implemented as part of the IP layer. So ICMP processing can be viewed as occurring parallel to, or as part of, IP processing. 
* ICMP is shown as a layer 3 protocol.
* ICMP is probably most well known as the message protocol used for the ping command. 
* A ping command sends an ICMP echo request to the target host. 
* The target host responds with an echo reply. 
* The ping command is losing some of its usefulness in today's more security-conscious networks: many routers disable responses to echo requests.
* ICMP for Internet Protocol version 4 is called ICMPv4 and for Internet Protocol version 6 is called ICMPv6. 
* It is used by network devices, including routers, to send error messages and operational information indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.
* ICMP differs from transport protocols such as TCP and UDP because it is not typically used to exchange data between systems.
* ICMP messages are typically used for diagnostic or control purposes or generated in response to errors in IP operations

* ICMP uses the  Type 8 & 0 because ICMP uses these mesaages types to test the connectivity.
* Initiating the generation of echo request to test IP.
* Once Test machine gets the ping request then it reply back to source host.

* ICMP type 3 messages Destination unreachable alterts a source host of delivery problems while trying to reach destination.
* Remember Destination host can send only code types 2 & 3 But router can send all codes.
* Destination unreachable uses the several codes values to Source host Which describes the function of ICMP message being sent.

* Router canot find the destination network address.
* Router cannot deliver or forward an IP datagram to destination network.

* The host unreachable message alerts the sending host that the destination host requested cannot be found

* Protocol unreachable indicates that the Transport layer protocol (UDP or TCP) is not available. 
* The destination host or an intervening gateway might send this message.

* When application get failed on host itself.
* The destination host might send this message but host is not able to receive.

* This message occurs when a router receives a datagram that requires fragmentation.
* But the router has the DF flag turned on.

* Message occurs if a router encounters a next hop in the source route that does not reside on a directly connected network.

* Message occurs when a router receives an IP datagram that it cannot deliver or forward to a particular network because it is unknown.

* Message occurs when a router receives an IP datagram that it cannot deliver or forward to a particular network because it is not allowed. 
* Access to this network has been prohibited.

* Message occurs when a router receives an IP datagram that it cannot deliver or forward to a particular host because it is not allowed. 
* An administratively configured filter has prohibited access to this process or application.

* Message occurs when a router receives an IP datagram that it cannot deliver or forward to a particular host because the precedence level requested does not match, and is not accepted or is invalid.
