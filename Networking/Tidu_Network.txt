At each level N, two entities at the communicating devices (layer N peers) exchange protocol data units (PDUs) by means of a layer N protocol. 
Each PDU contains a payload, called the service data unit (SDU), along with protocol-related headers or footers.

Data processing by two communicating OSI-compatible devices is done as such:

* The data to be transmitted is composed at the topmost layer of the transmitting device (layer N) into a protocol data unit (PDU).
* The PDU is passed to layer N-1, where it is known as the service data unit (SDU).
* At layer N-1 the SDU is concatenated with a header, a footer, or both, producing a layer N-1 PDU. It is then passed to layer N-2.
* The process continues until reaching the lowermost level, from which the data is transmitted to the receiving device.
* At the receiving device the data is passed from the lowest to the highest layer as a series of SDUs while being successively stripped from each layer's header or footer, until reaching the topmost layer, where the last of the data is consumed.
