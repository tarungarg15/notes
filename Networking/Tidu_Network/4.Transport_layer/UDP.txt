====== UDP ======
Created Sunday 15 October 2017

* User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is one of the core members of the Internet protocol suite.
* With UDP, computer applications can send messages, in this case referred to as datagrams, to other hosts on an Internet Protocol (IP) network. 
* Prior communications are not required in order to set up communication channels or data paths.
* UDP uses a simple connectionless communication model with a minimum of protocol mechanism. 
* UDP provides checksums for data integrity, and port numbers for addressing different functions at the source and destination of the datagram. 
* It has no handshaking dialogues, and thus exposes the user's program to any unreliability of the underlying network; 
* There is no guarantee of delivery, ordering, or duplicate protection.

====== Attributes ======

[ ] UDP provides no guarantees to the upper layer protocol for message delivery and the UDP layer retains no state of UDP messages once sent. 
[ ] UDP sometimes is referred to as Unreliable Datagram Protocol.[

**A number of UDP's attributes make it especially suited for certain applications.**

	* It is transaction-oriented, suitable for simple query-response protocols such as the **Domain Name System or the Network Time Protocol.**
	* It provides datagrams, suitable for modeling other protocols **such as IP tunneling or Remote Procedure Call and the Network File System.**
	* It is simple, **suitable for bootstrapping** or other purposes without a full protocol stack, **such as the DHCP and Trivial File Transfer Protocol.**
	* **It is stateless**, suitable for very large numbers of clients, **such as in streaming media applications such as IPTV.**
	* **The lack of retransmission delays makes it suitable** for **real-time applications such as Voice over IP, online games**
	* Many protocols built on top of the Real Time Streaming Protocol.
	* It **works well in unidirectional communication and is suitable for broadcast information** 

====== Service ports ======

__Applications use datagram sockets to establish host-to-host communications. __
__An application binds a socket to its endpoint of data transmission, which is a combination of an IP address and a service port. __
__A port is a software structure that is identified by the port number, a 16 bit integer value, allowing for port numbers between 0 and 65535. __
__Port 0 is reserved, but is a permissible source port value if the sending process does not expect messages in response.__


**The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) has divided port numbers into three ranges.**

	1. **Port numbers 0 through 1023 are used for common, well-known services.** 
	2. **Port numbers 1024 through 49151 are the registered ports used for IANA-registered services.** 
	3. **Ports 49152 through 65535 are dynamic ports that are not officially designated for any specific service**

	== Source port number ==
	This 16 bits information is used to identify the source port of the packet.This 16 bits information is used to identify the source port of the packet.
	
	== Destination port number ==
	This 16 bits information, is used identify application level service on destination machine.
	
	== Length ==
	Length field specifies the entire length of UDP packet (including header). It is 16-bits field and minimum value is 8-byte, i.e. the size of UDP header itself.
	
	== Checksum ==
	This field stores the checksum value generated by the sender before sending. IPv4 has this field as optional so when checksum field does not contain any value it is made 0 and all its bits are set to zero.
