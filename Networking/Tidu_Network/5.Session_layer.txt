====== 5.Session layer ======
Created Saturday 14 October 2017

=== This layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations. Services include authentication and reconnection after an interruption.    On the Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provide these services for most applications. ===

* The session layer provides the mechanism for opening, closing and managing a session between end-user application processes,
* Communication sessions consist of requests and responses that occur between applications. 
* Session-layer services are commonly used in application environments that make use of remote procedure calls (RPCs).

**An example of a session-layer protocol is the OSI protocol suite session-layer protocol, also known as X.225 or ISO 8327.** 

1. In case of a connection loss this protocol may try to recover the connection. 
2. If a connection is not used for a long period, the session-layer protocol may close it and re-open it. 
3. It provides for either full duplex or half-duplex operation and provides synchronization points in the stream of exchanged messages
4. Sessions are most commonly implemented on Web browsers using protocols such as the Zone Information Protocol, the AppleTalk Protocol and the Session Control Protocol.

====== Example :- RPC ======

**Working of Remote Procedure Call :- **

1. RPC is working as a client server model

2. RPC uses different Authentication methods to validate the client request.

3. RPC protocol is independent of transport layer protocols.

4. RPC reuests can use both UDP and TCP but prefer UDP format

In RPC the client issues requests for certain services from server through the network.
A client is a computer or process that accesses the services or resources of another process or computer on the network. 
A server is a computer that provides services and resources, and that implements network services.In short the requesting program is a client and the service-providing program is the server. 
According to the results of RPC authentication server may reject or accept the request.


**Remote Procedure Call(RPC) Authentications**

The major Remote Procedure Call (RPC) authentication methods are provided below.


**1 Null Authentication**

Often calls must be made where the caller does not know who he is or the server does not care who the caller is.

**2 UNIX Authentication**

The caller of a remote procedure may wish to identify himself as he is identified on a UNIX(tm) system.

**3 DES Authentication**

DES Authentication is the advance form of UNIX Authentication.

UNIX command to display the RPC programs that are registered on a specified computer.

rpcinfo -p
