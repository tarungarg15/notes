* Physical layer is the lowest layer of all. It is responsible for sending bits from one computer to another. 
* This layer is not concerned with the meaning of the bits and deals with the physical connection to the network and with transmission and reception of signals.
* This layer defines electrical and physical details represented as 0 or a 1. 
* How many pins a network will contain, when the data can be transmitted or not and how the data would be synchronized.
