====== GET Method ======

A GET request retrieves data from a web server by specifying parameters in the URL portion of the request. This is the main method used for document retrieval. 


====== HEAD Method ======

The HEAD method is functionally similar to GET, except that the server replies with a response line and headers, but no entity-body.

====== POST Method ======

The POST method is used when you want to send some data to the server, for example, file update, form data, etc. 

====== PUT Method ======

The PUT method is used to request the server to store the included entity-body at a location specified by the given URL.

====== DELETE Method ======

The DELETE method is used to request the server to delete a file at a location specified by the given URL

====== CONNECT Method ======

The CONNECT method is used by the client to establish a network connection to a web server over HTTP.

====== OPTIONS Method ======

The OPTIONS method is used by the client to find out the HTTP methods and other options supported by a web server. The client can specify a URL for the OPTIONS method, or an asterisk (*) to refer to the entire server. 

====== TRACE Method ======

The TRACE method is used to echo the contents of an HTTP Request back to the requester which can be used for debugging purpose at the time of development.
