=== Let us understand the stack from stack point of view :- ===

1. we will try to get socket — Datagram sockets for UDP along with user has to pass the UDP protocol number
2. Pass the IPO version also — in our stack we are passing IPV6
3. CONFIG_NET_MAX_CONTEXTS → Number of network contexts to allocate
	default value is 6 
	
	Each network context is used to describe a network 5-tuple that is used when listening or sending network traffic. 
	This is very similar as one could call a network socket in some other systems.
	

	/** Protocol families */
	#define PF_UNSPEC	0	/* Unspecified.  */
	#define PF_INET		2	/* IP protocol family.  */
	#define PF_INET6	10	/* IP version 6.  */
